            <title><![CDATA[Another favourite from India. this one, from Khajuraho. I just love to colours here and his expression. this was an old village where everyone was so pleased to be photographed. they loved to see their images in the camera. With no Hindi at my disposal, it was a fun way of communicating!]]></title>
